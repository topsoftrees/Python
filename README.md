# Python
I don't have any experience with Python but I do with C++ and Java. I might breeze through the Python documentation but not go too in depth. Some of the projects I'm hoping to work on are
- Ping verification (8/29/22-8/30/22)
- Go through socket module
- Go through os module
- Go through popen module
- Create a network analyzer
